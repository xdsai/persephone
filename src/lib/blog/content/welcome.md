summary: welcome to my space for projects, notes, and tinkering.

hey.

you found this place—by accident or on purpose. either way, welcome! this is my little corner of the internet. i’ll use it to document side projects and how i build them: what broke, what worked, and why.

## about me

i’m alex. born in 2002 (you can do the math on how old i am). i like hands-on, practical things more than theory. in my free time i write code—everything from small automations to bigger tools i think are useful.

i also wrench on my own motorcycles, cars, and other mechanical toys. modding them is my happy place: making something non-conventional and tailored to my taste. my sense of what “looks right” has evolved over the years—subjective, sure—but i tend to see projects through until they’re *almost* perfect before moving on.

## this site

the first project i’m documenting is… this website. fun fact: i barely know frontend. and yet, here we are :D

the source is on [github](https://github.com/xdsai/persephone). the code isn’t pristine, but it’s not a disaster either. borrow ideas or copy it 1:1—i don’t mind. a terminal-style homepage isn’t the most original concept, but it fits me.

## work

i work as an infrastructure security administrator at **ESET**. i started as a junior right after my bachelor’s, moved to secAdmin I six months later, and i’m aiming for the next step. most of my day is network security—on-prem and cloud. i work with **AWS** and **Azure** (leaning AWS; their private DNS just feels more intuitive :D).

## closing

nobody’s whole story fits in a single post—and that’s fine. this isn’t a memoir; it’s a place to build in public.

a weird blog hidden in the depths of the abyss.  
what blog?
