summary: welcome to the blog!

hey.

you've stumbled upon this page, either by accident, or intentionally. either way, welcome! this is my little corner of the internet. i will attempt to continually either document my life here, in a capacity that i see fit. i mainly want to document my side projects in the form of blog posts where i describe what i struggled with and how things work. 

but first, a bit about me. 

my name's alex. i was born on 2002, so that makes me current_date - 2002, do the math yourself. i like everything technical, not too keen on theoreticals. that means i like coding stuff in my spare time, be it useless side projects which are just fun little pieces of automation, up to bigger things that i deem useful. i wrench on my own motorcycles (yay speed), cars and other items of the mechanical nature. modding them is what gives me the happy brain chemicals - when i have something non-conventional, modified up to my tastes. over the years, i feel i developed an unique taste for what looks good, but tastes are subjective. so every once in a while, i move onto a different project - though not before i feel the last one is near-perfect.

the first project that i see fit to document wholly is this website. fun fact! i don't know the first thing about frontend coding. and yet this page exists! :D the code for it is available at [github](https://github.com/xdsai/persephone). the code isn't the cleanest, but its not the worst either. take inspiration from it if you see fit, or reuse 1:1, i don't really care. i also dont think a terminal as a personal webpage is the most original of ideas, but it works quite well for who i am. and well, who am i? my name and age is known. i work as an infrastructure security administrator in ESET. started as a junior after completing bachelor's, moved up to secAdmin I after 6 months, and now aiming at the next promotion. i mostly do network security related tasks, be it on-premise or cloud. my expertise lies in AWS and Azure, though i like AWS a bit more as their privateDNS system is more intuitive :D 

and really, thats it. a person is so much deeper than a couple lines in a blog post, but this isn't the right place to put my life's story, as noone really cares. 

a weird blog hidden in the depths of the abyss. 
what blog?

alex
